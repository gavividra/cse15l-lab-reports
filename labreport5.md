### In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from your lab experience in the second half of this quarter that you didn’t know before. It could be a technical topic we addressed specifically, something cool you found out on your own building on labs, something you learned from a tutor or classmate, and so on. It doesn’t have to be specifically related to a lab writeup, we just want to hear about cool things you learned!

In a couple of sentences, I have learned a lot about how to edit my files without going into the file. Starting with week 5, I developed the skills needed to find documents and find the number of words and characters in the document, or search for specific words in the document. Moving onto later in the quarter, I got used to using `.sh` files to create a function that would call multiple commands in terminal instead of needing to write these commands every time. Lastly, using `vim` I was actually able to edit the code in a file via my terminal. I believe that all these functions are very useful as they will help me optimize the way I write-up, edit code in the future.
